    "description": "During a SURF at Caltech with John Preskill and Samson Wang, we developed algorithms using product formulae and Richardson extrapolation to boost accuracy and cut circuit depth for quantum phase estimation and Green’s functions. We also made a partially randomized version that works great for Hamiltonians with big dominant terms, like in quantum chemistry. Our methods need just one ancilla qubit, have low circuit depth, and are ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.",

    "description": "This tutorial, done with the CMU Quantum Technologies Group and published in the 2025 Tutorials in Operations Research, gives a hands-on intro to solving QUBO problems on IBM’s gate-based and D-Wave’s annealer quantum machines. We cover basics, key concepts, two heuristics, and practical examples, with code available on GitHub. It’s perfect for students and pros starting to explore real-world quantum computing.",
